# DOS Player
16-bit Assembly based 8-bit WAV player.

## Compiling
Simply execute the 'compile.bat' file through a DOS emulator: (I used DOSBox)

```
> compile.bat
```

Note: the compiler used is called 'Turbo Assembler'.

## Executing
Make sure that the generated files are in the same directory:
- Player.exe
- splash.wav

Then simply run the program, and pass the music files as arguments:
```
> Player.exe file1.wav file2.wav file3.wav file4.wav ...
```
